Project 2- Finding phi category for sum of logs

Project 2 Finding  Category for Sum of Logs
Suppose you have a function dened by
T(n) = log2(1) + log2(2) +    + log2(n):
Your job on this Project is to apply the previous discussion to nd a well-known function
g(n) such that T(n) 2 (g(n))|and prove it, of course, by bounding T(n) above and
below by functions that you can integrate, both of which are in (g(n)).
